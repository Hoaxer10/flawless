                                         <p>- In the event that the bid is placed and the time expires and you are the winner of the bid and the purchase has not been completed for three times, your account will be banned to reduce manipulation.</p>
                                         <p>- All payments, buying and selling will be done by the site administrator to avoid manipulation and build trust between users.</p>
